## This is the home of support for socially and environmentally positive enterprises.

The network delivers Community and Capability Building services through Hubs nationally.

Our mission is to continue what we has already begun, the creation of a fully connected, flax-roots-up ecosystem of support across Aotearoa, New Zealand.

### A Network Which:

– democratises and facilitates face-to-face and online access to capability building tools, experts and professionals,

– creates opportunities for entrepreneurs to find their peers to learn from each other,

– opens pathways for funding and investment to be allocated,

– makes Hubs more impactful, connecting and serving more entrepreneurs, **who contribute to New Zealand's wellbeing through the development of enterprises which nourish and connect our people and places.**

+++

## What kinds of enterprises do we support?

There are all sorts of social, or impact, enterprises across a wide range of industries and professions. They provide a means to improve social wellbeing, environmental recovery and sustainability, and economic equality in Aotearoa. They are enterprises which are purpose-driven organisations of people who trade to deliver social and environmental impact.

**If your organisation has a positive social, environmental or economic equality mission and provides public or community benefit:**

– Sells goods or services to fund your mission,

– Derives a substantial portion of income from trade, and

– Uses the majority of profit/surplus in the fulfilment of your mission; **you will find support for your work to achieve great outcomes for New Zealanders available to you locally through Community-led Enterprise Development Network Hubs.**

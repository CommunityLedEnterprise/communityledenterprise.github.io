## Where we started

The 2019 Department of Internal Affairs Social Enterprise Sector Development Program (SESDP) named the 'Impact Initiative' is a three-year programme commissioned by the Government to grow social enterprise in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Led by the Akina Foundation with support from the Community Enterprise Network Trust (CENT) this network was bought together through the 'Capability needs' work stream of the Impact Initiative. See Akina's Hubs Insights Report of the 10 month ‘Hubs Pilot’ project here.

## What we strive to do

1. Increase visibility and access to support for Founders of socially and environmentally positive enterprises across Aotearoal

2. Offer relevant and meaningful business support tools and programmes;

3. Create pathways to capital to enable enterprises to deliver common-good outcomes;

4. Build connections needed for a stronger, more connected ecosystem.

## Being Place Based

Being place-based is key to creating the conditions which support Founders who create positive-outcome-focused enterprises to thrive.

The building and gathering of community around Founders enables peer-to-peer learning, better access to resources of experience and expertise and trusted relationships which lead to capital to support the public-value creating enterprises being deployed.

## Who's in the network

– Entrepreneurs themselves (‘Founders’);

– Experts, providers and connectors who support ('Contributors');

– Funders, investors, buyers/procurers ('Supporters')

– Curators, Co-ordinators, Facilitators (’Hubs Champions’)

The network is growing and expanding as more hubs join, and stronger connections between hubs form.
